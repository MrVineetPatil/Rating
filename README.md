# Rating App
#### Assignment given for second round of internship for "Stamurai" Company(https://stamurai.com) on Internshala.Below given is the assignment:

You have to create an Android app in which users can assign a rating. 

1. The rating is a whole number between 0-9. But, the user should have the ability to set a minimum and a maximum rating. For example, the user should have the ability to limit the rating between say 1-5 or 1-9 (But he cannot make it 1-10).

2. On the home screen of the app, there should be a button which has the text "Rating <Range>". For example if the range set by the user is 1-6, the text on the button should be "Rating 1-6".

3. On clicking the button, a screen should open up. The screen has a slider where the user can select a rating and a submit button. Pressing the submit button saves the rating and resets the slider.

4. There should be a separate screen which shows the history of all submitted ratings with the date and time they were submitted on. These should persist across app launches.

**Note:
1) Do not use third party libraries for UI
2) Make range easy to configure â€” There should be just 1 variable somewhere in the app that can change rating range

# **Instructions to run the app:**
